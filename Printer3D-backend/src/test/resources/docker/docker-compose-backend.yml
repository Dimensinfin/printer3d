# TESTING - Docker Composer components
#
# Docker composer automatically creates a network. The container host matches the container name.
#
# Then configure the postgres database to start on that network. There is a health check so the application
#   will be able to wait until the database has completed the startup.
# The database will be then on location:
#   jdbc:postgresql://postgres-dev:5432/postgres
# To access the database from DBeaver we use the URL
#   jdbc:postgresql://0.0.0.0:5432/postgres user=inno-user password=inno-password
#
# The application to be accessed from Postman or the Acceptance Test platform is at location:
#   http://0.0.0.0:9500/actuator/health

version: '3.3'
