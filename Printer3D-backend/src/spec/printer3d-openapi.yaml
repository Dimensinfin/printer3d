  title: 3D Printer Queue Management API
  description: >
    # Summary

    ### This is the OpenApi specification active and matching the latest published backend application version seen on the Heroku Production servers.
    This API defines all the client REST endpoints public and available to other systems. The API definition follows the OpenApi 3.0 specification
    and there are provisioning for automatic code generation for this API clients.

    ##
    The current API specification matches the Printer3D backend system published with version **0.4.0**.

    # API Description

    The API will expose the next list of entities:

    * **Part** - This is the definition of an item that can be sold independently. The Part is the view side from the 3D printer stand view. Parts
    define the time slot use of the 3D printer and have some cost and price attached. The Part will also store the stock information so for active
    parts this information is used to calculate the jobs pending to stabilize a stock level.
    * ** Inventory** - This is the list of Parts declared on the system. Used as the base point to generate the list of print jobs. Reading the
    list of parts and evaluating the stock levels we can obtain the list of jobs that are required to complete the stock levels.
