    # Summary

    ### This is the OpenApi specification active and matching the latest published backend application version seen on the Heroku Production servers.
    This API defines all the client REST endpoints public and available to other systems. The API definition follows the OpenApi 3.0 specification
    and there are provisioning for automatic code generation for this API clients.

    # System Description

    The system is composed of 4 subsystems interconnected by interchange lines. The first system represents the *external user demand*. This system
    has a catalog of items and generates a queue of Requests. This is connected to the second subsystem that is the *Storage* system. The storage
    contains the elements available to other systems or the elements to generate Parts and Models. This second system connects with the third
    subsystem called *Production* that is the responsible to calculate and control the elements to be produced and the tool to build them. The input
    are the demands from Storage to keep the stocks or to fulfill the customer Requests. And finally this reports to the four subsystem to buy
    materials and tools to maintain the Production operative and at the right levels.


    Not all the systems have an application implementation. There are two main applications. One called **frontend** to deal with the Graphical User
    Interface to create any of the items persisted on the backend and to control the Storage and another called **backend** to persist all the
    system data and to run the different Production algorithms that are required to fulfil the demands on a proper service basis.


    This API is the communication channel between the backend and the frontend and represents a contract so the two applications can be developed
    independently but having the assurance that they will interface properly when deployed into their corresponding hardware.

    # API Description

    The API will expose endpoints aggregated by the information unit. Entities under the same information unit share part of the path. For example
    the Inventory is an information unit that will report the existence of different types of elements like Parts or Materials. All these entities
    are part of the system Inventory.


    Each of the subsystems can be view as an autonomous information section sharing the same repository and server. We have currently identified
    two of those information sections, the **Inventory** and the **Production**

    ## INFORMATION UNITS

    ### INVENTORY UNIT

    Under the **Inventory** information unit we now can found some types of entities. The **Parts** are models that can be built with the other
    entity that is the plastic filament material identified by the **Material** entity. There should be a third entity called **Machine** that is
    where the plastic filament is converted on the Part. We have added a fourth element called **Model** that is a list of Parts and that allows
    for a hierarchical concept on the list of build items.

    * **Part** - This is the definition of an item that can be sold independently. The Part is the view side from the 3D printer stand view.
    Parts entities have some aspects. The principal aspect is the point where it collects the information required by the Machine to build an
    element. Parts then define the materials required for the construction and the model to use to give the material the appearance required. Parts
    define the time slot use of the 3D printer and have some cost and price attached. The Part will also store the stock information so for active
    parts this information is used to calculate the jobs pending to stabilize a stock level.

    * **Model** - A model is a collection of Parts that are required to build a new item. There are simple items that can be sell only by building
    a Part but also there are complex elements that are composed of more than one Part. Each of the Parts can have their own color and material.
    The Model has then a list of the Part references that should be composed at the UI and than can be modified but only on the list of Part
    composition.

    * **Coil** - To build a Part we require to use a plastic filament **Coil** on a 3D printer so we can print a thin plastic layer upon
    another layer until we have the model complete. The **Coils** are the storage for the plastic. It comes in long mono filament plastic lines of
    thousands of metres of length. Usually they are bought by weight.

    * **Finishing** - This is an especial response entity to collect all the distinct colors available for an specific type of material.

    * **Machine** - This is the entity that describes a 3D printer model and its configuration. The information about Machines is hardcoded at
    initialization time and the machine records can only update the current build **Part** job. Each Machine has a slot to record the current
    build action this machine is running. This data will keep track of the remaining time to complete the job and then update the stock records.

    ### PRODUCTION UNIT

    On this information unit we can find a virtual job generator that will use a set of rules to construct a list of the jobs required to reach a
    target on the **Inventory** unit. If the stock levels are below the stock limits then the missing Parts are added as build jobs until the
    number desired is reached. Other rules are able to increase or decrease this number depending on other measures or also decide the better
    schedule order for the list already generated.
    Added to the jobs generated by the inventory leveling now there another source for Jobs. The customer Requests can reduce the inventory levels
    by buying Parts and Models. One a Request is fulfilled the inventory requirements have changed and there can be new jobs pending. Jobs required
    to complete pending Requests because the stock is empty will be prioritized over stock leveling jobs.

    On the **Production** information unit we can find the list of Pending Jobs.

    * **Job** - The information required to report the 3D machine owner the necessity to build a particular **Part**. It should indicate the
    correct model and **Finishing**. There is a job for every single Part. If the machine is able to build more than one identical part at the same
    time this should be controlled on the frontend user interface.

    * **Request** - This is an entity used by the customers to report the items they want to buy. The **Request** contains the list of
    specific Part models along with the material and color that are required by the customer. Also Requests can contain Models that are packaged
    sets of Parts that are sell together. Requests are processed by order of arrival when the list of current open requests is solicited by the
    frontend. The system will follow the first come/first served pattern. Then Part build jobs generated by Requests have a higher priority than
    other jobs generated by inventory leveling.
    A **Request** can be on different states. It starts on the state **OPEN** when the request is created. When the frontend requests the list of
    open
    buy requests then it is compared against the current stock levels. If all the items on the request are available then it moves to the state
    **COMPLETED**. If the user at the frontend delivers the request to the customer it can then close is and remove the items from the inventory. At
    this point the request moved to the final state of **CLOSED**.

      summary: Creates a new Request instance at the persistence repository.
      description: >
        This is an entity used by the customers to report the items they want to buy. The **Request** contains the list of
            specific Part models along with the material and color that are required by the customer. Also Requests can contain Models that are packaged
            sets of Parts that are sell together. Requests are processed by order of arrival when the list of current open requests is solicited by the
            frontend. The system will follow the first come/first served pattern. Then Part build jobs generated by Requests have a higher priority than
            other jobs generated by inventory leveling.
            A **Request** can be on different states. It starts on the state **OPEN** when the request is created. When the frontend requests the list of
            open
            buy requests then it is compared against the current stock levels. If all the items on the request are available then it moves to the state
            **COMPLETED**. If the user at the frontend delivers the request to the customer it can then close is and remove the items from the inventory. At
            this point the request moved to the final state of **CLOSED**.

        The pending list of jobs now has two targets. On the first priority level it is the fulfilment of all the Open Requests. Requests are then
        processed on order of arrival and if there are not enough Parts on the inventory to complete a Request then that missing Parts generate
        build jobs that should be completed on high priority.
        The second target is then add the jobs to complete the inventory levels. For that the system will search the **Inventory** needs and stocks
        mismatches to create a list of the Parts missing to reach the correct stocks levels for each part and each finishing.
        ## RULES
        1. Jobs generated by Request missing parts have priority 1.
        2. Jobs generated by stock leveling have priority 2.
        3. Within priority 2 jobs sort by finishing count being the finishing with more hits up on the list.

            the Request.
    RequestItem:
      type: object
      description: >
        Now a Request item can be of different types. So there is a need to use an isolation class that will contain the neutral data and be ale to
        locate the detail record form the right repository. So the list of Parts now is transformed to a list of items.
        A request item then has the type of item and the quantity of the same items.
      required:
        - itemId
        - type
        - quantity
      properties:
        itemId:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/UUID'

            - PART
            - MODEL
          description: >
            This field differentiates the repository element pointed by the id. Being the id formats common the type will inform from which
            repository to extract the item data details.
          example:
            MODEL
        quantity:
          type: number
          format: int32
          default: 1
          minimum: 1
          description: >
            The number of copies of the item that are requested. Each sellable item that has any difference to any other sellable item has a unique
            identifier. Copies means the number of exact elements with the same identifier.
          example:
            3

    Request:
      type: object
      description: >
        This is the data structure that is received/sent over the HTTP interface. When the user creates or changes the Request the service will
        receive a copy of this structure and then return an updated and persisted copy.
      required:
        - id
        - requestDate
        - label

          description: >
            The unique identifier for a single Request. Once a request is closed cannot be edited so the user will need to create a new instance.
            This field is used for primary keying the requests.
          example:
            009ab011-03ad-4e84-9a88-25708d1cfd64
        requestDate:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          description: >
            The date and time when the Request is submitted to the backend. Used for request ordering on the FIFO request list.
          example:
            2020-06-01T22:05:00Z

          maxLength: 50
          description: >
            The user readable label to be assigned to a single Machine. Can be used instead of the unique identifier UUID.
          example:
            'Machine A'

            Requests that should be sent to the customer but that still have missing Parts should stay at the OPEN state until the Request is
            completed and it is served. When the transaction completes then the requests moves to the CLOSED state and then cannot be changed.
            State descriptions:
            * **OPEN** - The Requests are created on this state. This is the value stored at the database while the Request is not closed. Open
            requests are listed to the frontend and at that moment they can change to COMPLETED if there are enough Parts.
            * **COMPLETED** - This is the state refected when the Request is listed to the frontend. This state is not stored at the repository.
            Means that the Request can be served to the customer and then closed.
            * **CLOSED** - The Request has been sent to the customer and the Parts removed from the inventory stock. This is the final state for
            the Request.
