Feature: [D3D04]-Define the requirements for the New Part dialog interactions

    If the user interacts with Inventory features that affect the Parts there should be requirements to control the
    presentation, contents and interaction flow. Parts cannot be eliminated but some of their fields are editable
    once the part is constructed.
    This feature will deal with the requirements when a new Part is created.

    Background: Dock Default Configuration setup
        Given the application Printer3DManager
