Feature: [D3D04]-Define the requirements for the New Part dialog interactions

    One of the key elements to work are the Parts. They are created on a Dialog that has two entries. The first is a Feature button that creates a new Part.
    The second is duplicating a previous existing Part inheriting some but not all of the field values.
    Describe and test the creation of a new Part.
